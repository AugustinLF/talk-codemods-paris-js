## Codemods my teams ran

- Tape -> jest
- Mocha + chai -> jest
- Decorators -> HOC
- flow version bump
- Props renaming on react components
- ~150 components from components/index to components/myComponent

---

## Regex, search & replace are not always sufficient

---

```js
import createUser from "createUser";

// before
createUser({ name: "Augustin" });

// after
createUser({ name: "Augustin", id: null });
```

---

```javascript
import makeUser from "createUser";

// before
makeUser({ name: "Augustin" });

// after
makeUser({ name: "Augustin", id: null });

// How are you suppose to know that makeUser
// corresponds to createUser?
```

## How a codemod works?

---

- Source code -> AST
- Query and manipulate the AST
- Convert back the new AST to source code

---

## Abstract Syntax Tree

<Notes>
  This is not specific to jscodeshift, not to JavaScript. This follows a spec
  made by Mozilla. You'll find AST when working on plugins for babel or eslint,
  or whenever you'll work with a compiler.

- jscodeshift is a CLI tool that will go through your files, send them to child processes, etc.
- Use a parser to create an AST from a string: babel, flow, ts
- Attach metadata to the AST to better navigate (`path.parent`) for instance, thanks to recast & ast-types. This also lets us keep the formatting of the code
- Transform this AST, using jscodeshift with a jquery-like API. Create new nodes using ast-types.
- Print the AST back to code
