## The state of React

---

The future of React

- React Fire -> lot of things about the DOM, event system, className to class
- React Fusion -> compiler for React
- React Native Fabric -> Fiber for React Native
- React Flare -> Event primitives with hooks

---

## Scheduling

---

Faster is not good enough.

"The more money you have, the more money you spend"

---

We need to be able to prioritize CPU work. And interrupt tasks. That's called scheduling.

---

Today, limited support for schedulers on the platform.

But things are being worked on.

---

## Yarn 2

---

At first, a package manager. Simple npm competitor.

---

Workspaces? PnP?

---

### The future

---

Making our life easier

- constraints
- yarn dlx
- interactive installs

---

### Game changing

---

## ReasonReact

---

Demo time.
